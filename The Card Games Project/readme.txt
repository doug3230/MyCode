Description: This is going to be a remake of Solitaire, the first nontrivial
piece of software I've ever written. In this project, I intend to use what
I've learned in a software engineering course to carry out the project
more effectively.

The folders and what is to be in them are as follows:

Requirements - This will include a requirements analysis of the project.
	       The requirements analysis includes things such as project scope,
	       desired features, required functionality, and so forth.

Analysis and Design - This folder will include planning for the implementation
		      before I actually code it. I intend to figure out all the
		      crucial details at this stage so that coding is not too troublesome.
		      This will include the decision of which tools, libraries, 
		      programming language(s), and design patterns to use in the implementation.

Implementation - This folder will include the code and documentation for the software that
		 ends up being written.


Testing will be done over the course of the project, not just during the implementation phase.
Documentation for the project as a whole (not including the code documentation for the 
implementation phase) will be kept in one or more log files.
