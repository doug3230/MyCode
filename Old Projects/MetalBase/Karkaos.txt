Karkaos is a Canadian 
Symphonic Death Metal
band with some influences 
of Folk Metal here and there.

The band is notable for
having a female vocalist 
(who is quite good if I might add)
known as 
Veronica Ortiz Rodriguez

At the moment, (July 17 2012) 
they've released only one EP 
called "In Burning Skies" 
along with a music video 
for track "The Tempest" 
which it seems the band 
had a lot of fun making. 

Stay tuned.
