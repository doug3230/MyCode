Instanzia is a Canadian Power Metal
band from Quebec with some 
influences of Progressive Metal.

The band is the brainchild of one
Alexis Woodbury who plays guitar,
sings, and writes many of their songs.

As of writing (July 17 2012) they
only have one album 
(titled "Ghosts") but it's pretty
decent.

Their song "The Desert Fox" is
based on the life of German 
WW2 field marshal 
Erwin Rommel.
