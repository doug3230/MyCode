A band from Quebec that 
seeks to use their music 
to combat any depression
that their audience may have.

Their singer's voice is a bit
deeper than most Power Metal
vocalists, but this works well.

At the moment I kind of see
them as a cross between
Manowar and Rhapsody.

In 2010 they released their
first album "Heart of Battle"
