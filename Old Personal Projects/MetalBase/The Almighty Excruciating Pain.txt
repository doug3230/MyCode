The Almighty Excruciating Pain is a 
Thrash Metal band from British Columbia
with some influences from Punk Rock but
also Technical Death Metal

Did I mention that they are awesome?
On Youtube they have uploaded some
excellent videos including "performance
videos" where you can see what each
band member is doing during certain 
songs.

Thus far they have released one
eponymous E.P. as well as a music 
video for the song Manatee.

Their music is lotsa fun to listen to.
Stay tuned.
