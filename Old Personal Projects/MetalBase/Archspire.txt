Archspire is a 
Technical Death Metal 
band from British Columbia.

They can play quite fast and
quite skillfully but also try to 
focus on good songwriting
with a quick  transition to 
acoustic instruments taking 
place in some of their songs.

Thus far they have released
one album called 
"All Shall Align"

It's pretty decent, I look 
forward to more from them.
