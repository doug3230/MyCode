Old Projects

Some old projects that I hope to remake at some point.

They are:
MetalBase - A heavy metal database (I did not know much about how databases work when I made this).
Snake - A game where you control a snake that tries to grow by eating food without crashing into itself or the walls.
Solitaire - My first nontrivial computer program. It holds a special place in my heart.
Space Invaders - This one was inspired by a book called Black Art of Java Game Programming.
Tetris - This one's a bit humourous. As you score points, the game becomes faster eventually to the point that blocks fall at speeds so high that the user cannot even react.

As usual, I am open to tips and criticism.
