VBA Course Final Project

This is a project I did for a VBA course at Laurier.
In short, it is a grading application that gets marks from
a comma separated file and course names from the registrar database.

It then outputs data into Excel or generates reports in Word.

More information about the assignment can be found in the CP212_A5 pdf.


Note: If you wish to try out the application, the importing may not work properly
if using a downloaded .csv file (this might have to do with read permissions). 
If this is the case, copy the contents of the .csv file into one that has been
created on your computer (VBA is quite quirky, I know).
